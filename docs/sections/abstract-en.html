<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This mini-ontology is essentially a controlled vocabulary at this point.  Developed for NSF's EarthCube program's Resource Registry, the long term intention is to flesh this out to more completely define the environments that software components can run in. If you would like to assist with this or in extending any of the other controlled vocabularies/ontologies developed as part of the Resource Registry project, please see https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-ecresourcereg.</span>
